### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a site that allows you to share code with others. It basically allows you to put a *git repository* online. Git is a program that helps with the management of code. If you want, you can find out a bit more about git now by reading the first part (down to Installation) of this [Get Started with Git](http://alistapart.com/article/get-started-with-git) article.

There are several other sites that are similar to GitHub e.g. [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org). GitHub is by far the most widely used.

GitHub also allows you to put a static website online for free, using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) - another feature that we will be making use of during the course.

### Forum guidlines

The forum should be seen as a resource both for you and everyone else who will ever take this course. Here are a few guidlines to help make it the best resource possible:

1. **New question = New topic**: If you have a question, create a new topic. If you have two questions, make two separate topics!
2. **Descriptive titles**: Try to make the topic title as descriptive as you can. Think of someone in the future who has the same problem as you. "404 - There isn't a GitHub page here" is a better title than "my site doesn't show up".
