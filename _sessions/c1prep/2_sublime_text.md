### Why do I need Sublime Text?

Sublime Text is a *text editor* - a program that can be used for writing code.

When you write code it is important that the editor stores just the text you wrote, so that it can be properly interpreted when you run it. Word processors, like MS Word, add a lot of extra information to the text you write - layout, font styles, etc. - so can't be used for this purpose.

You probably already have a text editor, such as notepad or textedit, on your laptop that could be used for writing code. Sublime Text is better because it also does *syntax highlighting* - it will colour your code, making it easier to see what's going on.

### Do I need to pay?

Sublime Text costs $70 but **you can use it for free** as it has an indefinite evaluation period. The duration of the course seems like a pretty reasonable period of time to evaluate the software. If you go on to use it after that you should consider getting a license - it's a good product and the guys who make it have to eat!

### Why Sublime Text?

There are many text editors available including many excellent free and/or open source ones. Sublime Text is a popular code editor in the web development world at the moment and benefits from an active community of developers contributing add-ons and improvements. Although it isn't free or open source, we have chosen it as our recommended editor as it: (a) gives a good user experience on mac, linux and windows; (b) is easy to get started with; and (c) can be easily customised when you get more advanced.

If have a different text editor that you are already used to using, feel free to use that instead!
