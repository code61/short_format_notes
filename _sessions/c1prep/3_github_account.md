title: git & GitHub
---

Git is a program that helps with the management of code. It means that you completely avoid the situation where you end up with files called `team_contacts_v1`, `team_contacts_v2` etc. It also allows you to share your code with others and collaborate on code in an efficient way.

GitHub is a site that makes sharing code part of git really easy. It is the go-to choice both for startups and open-source software projects. (There are several other sites that are similar to GitHub e.g. [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org), but GitHub is the most widely used.)

GitHub also allows you to put a static website online for free, using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). We will be making use of this feature during the course.

git itself is the sort of program that you have to run by typing commands into your computer's command line. At some point, you will need to know how to do this but, for the time being, we're going to use a *git client* - an point-and-click application to make git easier. In particular, we're going to be using the git client provided by GitHub. Downloading GitHub's git client will install both the git command line progam and the point-and-click application.

{% exercise %}
1. Sign up for a GitHub account at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/). Make sure you **know your password** to avoid awkward moments in class!
2. Download [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com/) or [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/). If you're using linux, contact your course instructor.
